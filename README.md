<h1 align="center">Hey there 👋, I'm Mr_Julus</h1>
<h3 align="left">Who I am ? </h3>
A Junior Developper <br>
I'm 17 soon to be 18 and I'm from Switzerland. <br>
I like to develop small projects just for fun. <br>
I like playing video games, I play Brawl stars or Fortnite (on my phone...). <br>
I'm probably coding “Dark Dus” <br>
- which is a project I created because I had trouble finding a Fortnite client that uses fnbr on github. <br><br>
