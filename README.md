## Hi there 👋

> I'm a Junior Developper
> I'm 17 soon to be 18 and I'm from Switzerland.
> I like to develop small projects just for fun.
> I like playing video games, I play Brawl stars or Fortnite (on my phone...).
> I'm probably modifying “Dark Dus” which is a project I created because I had trouble finding a Fortnite client that uses fnbr on github.
> You can also visit my small website : https://mr-julus.is-a.dev
